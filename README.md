The database is quite simple.  Here is the script that creates it:

        CREATE TABLE game (
            id int IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
            game varchar(255) NOT NULL,
            code varchar(50) NOT NULL
        )
        
        CREATE TABLE host (
            id int IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
            streamer varchar(50) NOT NULL
        )
        
        CREATE TABLE streamer(
            id int IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
            discord varchar(50) NOT NULL,
            streamer varchar(50) NOT NULL
        )

Coming Soon
===========
1.4.2
-----
* Upgrade to new Twitch library that uses the new Helix API.
* Nothing to see here. üò¥

1.4.1
-----
* Discord.js update to get channels inside categories working as expected.
* Remove streamers that are no longer on the Discord server.
* Get out. üëâ

Version History
===============
1.4 - 12/25/2017
----------------
* Implement advanced logging which outputs bot activity to #bot-activity, and error activity to #bot-errors.
* Implement channel categories, with one each for bot channels, general channels, streamer channels, and voice channels.
* Enhance bot output using Discord Rich Embeds, with text-only fallbacks.
* Eliminate `!addtwitch`, `!removetwitch`, and `!confirm` commands, and just automatically determine if the user is a Six Gaming streamer using statuses on Discord.
* Damn, I'm pretty. üòç

1.3.1 - 11/27/2017
------------------
* Code refactored for readability.
* * Main module now only handles initial connect and startup calls.
* * Separate modules for database, Discord API, Twitch API, and Tmi connectivity.
* * Preparing for advanced logging by breaking out logging into its own module and adding an exception module to throw errors along with where they occurred.
* * Randomonium is now in its own module.
* * * Added Doomfist and Moira to randomonium.
* * Commands are now in their own module, and are used by instanciating the Commands class with whether the commands will be coming from Discord or Tmi.  Security on these commands are now done per command, which allows for commands to be shared between different services.
* Big update.  Zero new features. üíØ


1.3 - 5/22/2017
---------------
* Bot no longer pings @everyone when a streamer goes live.  Instead, you must `!streamnotify` to be alerted to when a streamer goes live, and `!streamunnotify` to turn it off.
* Bot no longer creates #game-* channels for every game that is created.
* Bot no longer creates #twitch-* text channels for every Twitch streamer who registers.  Instead, you must `!addmychannel` to create your text channel, and `!removemychannel` to remove it.
* It sucks less. üëå

-----------------
* Added Sombra and Orisa to `!randomonium`.

1.0.1 - 3/7/2016

1.0.0 - 3/2/2016
----------------

This is the initial release of the SixBotGG chat bot.

* Recognizes the !facebook, !twitter, !youtube, and !itunes commands from all users.
* Auto-cycles through the above four commands when both 10 minutes and 5 chat messages have occurred.
* Recognizes the !host <user> and !unhost commands from moderators.
* Automatically cycles every 10 minutes through hosting a select list of streamers when SixGamingGG is offline.
